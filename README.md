# NOBODY

'nobody' is an n-body simulator.
It is still in development and therefore it can contain some bugs.

## Building
For downloading 'nobody' and starting with the build process do the following.

    git clone https://github.com/lyrahgames/nobody.git
    cd nobody
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

## Usage
In the directory 'build' run the following.

    ./nobody

For some other data run the command with a file in the data directory.

    ./nobody ../data/<filename>
